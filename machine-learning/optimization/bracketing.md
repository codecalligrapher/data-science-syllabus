# Bracketing 
> Identifies interval within which local minimum lies and successively shrinking interval  

## Assumptions 
- Unimodal, single-parameter function  

## Types 
### Bisection Method  
- Cuts interval in half every iteration  
- Terminates when found midpoint has gradient of zero
- Requires bounds of interval on opposite side of zero
