# A/B Testing  
> Experiment with two groups to establish which of two treatments is superior  

## Key Terms  
#### Treatment  
Something to which a subject is exposed  

#### Treatment Group  
Group of subjects exposed to given treatment  

#### Control Group 
Group of subjects exposed to no (or standard) treatment  

#### Test Statistic  
Metric used to measure *effect* of treatment  


A difference between treatment groups can be due to **two** things:  
- The effect of treatment  
- Luck of the draw (e.g. random assignment may have accidentally clustered groups)
