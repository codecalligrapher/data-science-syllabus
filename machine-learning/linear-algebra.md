# Key Terms  
**Broadcasting**  
Arrays with different sizes cannot be added, subtracted, or generally be used in arithmetic. A way to overcome this is to duplicate the smaller array so that it is the dimensionality and size as the larger array. This is called array broadcasting and is available in NumPy when performing array arithmetic, which can greatly reduce and simplify your code.  

**Scalar**  
A physical quantity that it represented by a dimensional number at a particular point in space and time.

**Vector**  
Keep track of two pieces of information (typically magnitude and direction) for a physical quantity.  

**Tensor**  
The more general entity of a tensor encapsulates the scalar, vector and the matrix. It is sometimes necessary—both in the physical sciences and machine learning—to make use of tensors with order that exceeds two.

**Hadamard Product**  
Hadamard product is a binary operation that takes two matrices of the same dimensions and produces another matrix of the same dimension as the operands, where each element i, j is the product of elements i, j of the original two matrices.  

**Inverse Matrix**  
The inverse of matrix is another matrix, which on multiplying with the given matrix gives the multiplicative identity. The inverse of matrix is used of find the solution of linear equations through the matrix inversion method.  

**Determinant of a Matrix**  
Scaling factor of other entities under the current matrix transform  


**Span and Independence**  
The span of a set of vectors is the set of all linear combinations of the vectors. A set of vectors is linearly independent if the only solution to $c_1v_1 +...c_kv+k$ is $c_i$ for all $i$

**Manhattan Distance/L1 Norm**  
Sum of magnitudes of vectors in space.  

**Euclidean Distance/L2 Norm**  
Shortest distance from one point to another.
