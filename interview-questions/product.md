# Business  
**There is a pool of people who took Uber rides from two cities that were close in proximity, for example, Menlo Park and Palo Alto, and any data you could think of could be collected. What data would you collect so that the city the passenger took a ride from could be determined?”**  
To determine the city, we need to have access to the location/geographical data. The data collected could be GPS coordinates, longitude/latitude, and ZIP code


**What is the most important aspect of analytical reporting?**  
> *Analytical reporting is a type of business reporting that offers information, data analysis and recommendations. The recommendations are what set this type of reporting apart from informational reporting. Analytical reporting allows people to use data to make decisions.*   

While data itself cannot solve problems, it can equip you to make the right business decisions when analyzed in context. Even if a certain decision does not produce the results you expected, data allows you to learn from those results to continue improving. The most important aspect of analytical reporting is the ability to solve problems and make decisions based on facts. Attempting to make decisions based on uninformed guesses or assumptions can be problematic—analytical reporting provides tangible information with which to create strategy and direction

**Describe how you typically approach a project?**  
> General phases through which I get work done with standard deliverables 

I first listen to what a client needs, paying attention to what they articulate as their goals for the project. I then take a deeper look into our data to figure out how to guide them toward success or how to change the way they are looking at their goals to move forward in a more productive way. Of course, every project and every client requires something new, so I always make sure to consider the specific situation instead of automatically imposing a one-size-fits-all solution  

# Strategy  
*Should always be tied to business objectives*  
#### How would you turn Facebook events around?  
Step one: Set a business objective
First, we should confirm our understanding of the question and define a business objective. The question implies that there’s something wrong with Facebook events. Before starting to answer we should therefore clarify what exactly is wrong, so we can fix it.

Here are some questions that immediately come to mind to set the business objective:

What exactly is suffering about Facebook events? Engagement? Revenue? etc.
What would a successful turnaround look like?
Let’s assume that the interviewer has explained that lack of engagement needs to be fixed ASAP. And they have expressed interest in exploring solutions throughout the entire engagement funnel. Unfortunately, there isn’t an obvious metric to define engagement here as we’ll be working across the funnel, so we’ll have to do without one.

Step two: Generate solutions
The business objective is set, so now we’ll create a structure for brainstorming solutions. Let’s think about the different levels of engagement Facebook users can have with the events feature:

Awareness: users who are aware of the feature but have never used it
Basic engagement: users who have had some type of light interaction with event features, such as being invited or replying to an event
Deep engagement: users who have deeper interactions with the event feature, such as commenting on and creating events on a regular basis
Now we can generate solutions to increase user engagement within this structure.

1. Solutions to increase awareness of events:

Suggestions based user updates: Suggest events based on post / status updates (User: “So bored and feeling lonely” => Facebook: ”You might be interested in the following events this afternoon...”)
More ad options for businesses: Let businesses advertise special deals related to events they’ve organized (e.g. “50% off everything at happy hour, tonight only!”)
Allow more types of events to be pinned: Expand what type of events can be pinned at the top of user feeds (Like the “It’s time to vote!” event listing on election day - e.g. “Your local football team has a game today!”)
2. Solutions to increase basic engagement:

Increase urgency via design: Different UI might encourage more interactions before the event (e.g. A countdown clock “only one day left to RSVP!”)
Suggest invitations: For events with low RSVPs, suggest friends and family who aren’t invited yet to the event creator (e.g. “Your friends Shawn and Miles love movies - why not invite them to your movie night event?”)
Create a “why users are excited” feature: Add “why you are excited to attend” options for users who RSVP, then expose this on the event listing (e.g. Facebook: ”Let others know why you’re excited to attend: Location, Entertainment, Relaxation, Networking etc.” => Event listing: “Most users are excited for the entertainment at this event!”)
3. Solutions to increase deep engagement:

Event creation tips: Add tips for creating more engaging event posts, which in turn would reward the creator with more RSVPs and comments (e.g. pop ups on the event creation page like “Adding a picture increases comments on events by 20%” etc.)
Predict and auto-populate events: Predict and auto-populate events to encourage creation (e.g. ”Your birthday is coming up, remember to create an event related to your party. Here’s a basic one we made from your birthday event last year to get you started”)
Connect with Facebook Live: Include streaming options so that Facebook event pages are also used during events, and not just before they happen (e.g. broadcasting a concert with Facebook Live integration within the event page)
Step three: Discuss solutions
Let’s discuss the solutions we just brainstormed. Imagine that the interviewer tells us that the biggest drop off is from basic to deep engagement. Then it makes sense to focus on solutions which are designed to increase deep engagement. At this stage it’s a good idea to revisit these solutions and highlight trade-offs:

Event creation tips: We’ll want to validate that this solution will actually add value and not just get in the way with extra UI elements
Predict and auto-populate events: This solution has some dangerous edge cases, like reminding someone to create an anniversary event for a loved one who recently passed away
Connect with Facebook Live: This is likely an expensive and time consuming solution as we’d need to work with another team, and we’d want to avoid cannibalizing engagement for Facebook Live
Step four: Conclude
Finally, let’s summarize by making a recommendation while highlighting risks and next steps. Let’s imagine that “Event creation tips” came out as the most promising option in the previous discussion step. Here’s our conclusion:

- In order to turn Facebook events around, we need to maximize engagement
- Given the biggest opportunity is increasing deeper engagement, the first thing we’ll try is adding event creation tips, which should lead to more engaging event posts overall
