# Data Science Syllabus
*The foundations of this constitute a 3-month plan in preparation for interviews, and follow Jeff-Li's structure and four main areas of what an ideal data scientist should be able to do*  
## Technical 
> Is able to apply advanced techniques/concepts to multiple problems whilst writing elegant re-producable code, including their own packages

## Independent 
> Is paired with a Junior DS to mentor, with strong knowledge of multiple areas and captures synergies between the business

## Problem Formulation
> Develops the project roadmap to hit goals set by executive teams

## Influence 
> Partners with Project Managers on areas of expertise, is able to work to contribute to the project roadmap


# Directory of Files 
This is a collection of topics, resources and otherwise useful resources I found (am finding) during pursuit of my graduate degree in Data Science.
